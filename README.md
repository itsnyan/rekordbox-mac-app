## Features

- #### Backup your songs into folders using your Rekordbox playlists.

> When you import your songs into Rekordbox and organize them into playlists, especially when dealing with multiple genres, the original song files remain unorganized on your system. This application addresses that by taking your Rekordbox collection XML, parsing it, and creating a folder for each playlist. It then copies the corresponding songs from each playlist into these folders, effectively organizing your music files.
